"Anxiety Forest"
By Zoe Stead

How to Play:

You will be given a scenario that you must try and find the correct solution.

You will be given two options. Sometimes both options are correct, sometimes it's only one, and other times it's both that are incorrect.

When you are given the scenario, you must type into the terminal your answer.

I.e., "Your boss extends his hand to give you a handshake. Do you shake his hand?"

You would type either "yes" or "no" into the terminal. Failure to type the right option WILL END THE GAME, CAUSING YOU TO START OVER.

If you die, the game is over.

If you win, the game is over.

Play it wisely, and have fun.

Cheers,
